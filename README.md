# Laboratory programs and results for course "Engineering Numerical Methods".

All programs and scripts are written by me.

In order to get results, one has to use commands: `make; make run; make graph`.

*makefile* help: `make help`.

Tasks can be found [here](http://home.agh.edu.pl/~chwiej/imn_1.html)
